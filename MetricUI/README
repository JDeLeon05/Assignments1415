Using this code is quite simple:
  1. Enter the value you'd like to convert into the text field
  2. Press the radio button labled 'switch direction' if you'd like to convert in the opposite direction
      (Ex: pressing 'switch direction' then pressing 'Miles & Kilometers' will convert from kilometers to miles)
  3. Press 1 of the 4 buttons with metrics on their labels and the program should tell you the conversion
